  Requires PHP 5 on your web server.
  
  Three easy steps!
  
  Step 1: Edit config.php, and add your personal Foursquare RSS feed.
          You'll find your feed at https://foursquare.com/feeds.
          
          The URL should look like this:
          e.g. http://feeds.foursquare.com/history/8eb7a6350886ef4f4b680d89933fb4fc.rss
          
  Step 2: Save config.php and upload it together with the other files in any
          web folder on your webserver. Keep in mind that the script requires PHP 5.
          Check with your ISP's documentation if you're not certain to meet
          the requirements.
          
  Step 3: Call the script from your web browser. Share it with your friends.
